title: Polar H10 - ECG and ACC data
author: Stuart Lynne
---
## Overview

*fitness_dashboard* now supports capturing both *ECG* and *ACC* data from the *Polar H10*.

The Polar H10 implements three services:

- GATT Heart Rate Measurement
- Polar Measurement Data - ECG
- Polar Measurement Data - ACC

All three services can be independently enabled.

Also available is:

- Polar Features Configuration

## PFC

*Polar Features Configuration* is used to configure the Polar H10. 

Specifically the following can be enabled or disabled:
- multiconnection - allow one or two BLE connections (default: false)
- AntPlus - broadcast heart rate via ANT+ (default: true)
- Broadcast - broadcast heart rate for gym equipment (default: true)
- 5Khz - another broadcast of heart rate for gym equipment (default: true)

Enabling *multiconnect* makes use of the H10 with multiple hosts (e.g. Zwift and fitness\_dashboard) possible.

Disabling *Broadcast* and *5Khz* extends battery life if they are not needed.

N.b. re-inserting the battery resets the above to their defaults.


## ECG

ECG data is sampled at *130 Hz*. 

*fitness_dashboard* saves the data into the workout *FIT* file and into an activity CSV file.

## ACC

Accelerometer data can be sampled at any of these rates:

- 25 Hz
- 50 Hz
- 100 Hz
- 200 Hz

The data is stored in an activity file.
