## Overview

The *v0.32* release of *Fitness Dashboard* is finally out. 

This has several new major features:

- More BLE sensors, VO2Master, Oxylink Pulse Oximeter, Trainers that support FTMS
- Lap and event data from *Sauce for Zwift*
- Rewritten graphics that are substantially faster
- Mean Diff comparisons for two power meters or two heart rate monitors
- Tool-tips for most fields
- Implement data cursor to look at specific values


## Roadmap

Going forward these are the areas I'm targeting:

- additional Zwift event data from Sauce For Zwift
- ramp tests using VO2 or smO2 as control
- ECG display
- control panel to start/stop, laps, FIT file 
- reading FIT file for analysis
- pan and zoom for graph panel
- additional graph panels, ECG, VO2Master
- save graphs to PDF

## FIT Files

There is a separate Python command line utility, fitextract, that can extract any and all workout data 
from FIT files. See [Git Archive for fitextract](https://github.com/stuartlynne/fitextract).


## Faster Graphics

This was an interesting digression. 

There are two separate issues with *Matplotlib* graphing. 

- low frames per second for interactive plotting
- long latency to respond to Windows GUI events (resize or moving the application window etc)

Solving the interactive plotting requires using *blitting* but only partially solves the problem.
The other issue is that while some of the plots need to be updated for every draw (lines, and updated
numbers) other parts like the axis ticks, labels, and legends only need to be updated occasionally
if they change. 

The second issue means that when drawing the GUI needs to be able to process events every 100mS.

For anyone interested in the gory details see [Git Archive for drawanimated](https://github.com/stuartlynne/drawanimated).
