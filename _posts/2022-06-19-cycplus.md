# Cycplus 


The *Cycplus Ant+* dongle does not cope with multiple Ant+ devices.

This can be tested easily with the *Fitness_Dashboard* and three heart rate monitors.

## Trace Example

This is a typical sequence of the Cycplus failure under load, when stops responding at the USB layer to
IN transactions.

Fortunately this error is reported up the USB stack so that the device can be reset.

## Errors observed with *Cycplus Ant+ Dongle.*

This is a typical sequence of the Cycplus failure under load, when stops responding at the USB layer to
IN transactions. This requires that the entire Ant+/USB stack be stopped, reset, and restarted.

Hi.
I am steven. I am a R&D Engineer from CYCPLUS team.
Thanks for your support.
Because Nordic and Garmin will stop selling the IC(Nrf24ap2) for designing USB ant stick. So we have to change the solution. There are some bug in these products we sold from 10/2019 to 02/202. You canâ€™t ues ERG noemolly. We have solved the problem from now.
Please contact me if you have the problem about ERG.
My email is steven@cycplus.com.
We will send a new one to you for free.
So sorry for our mistake in work.
We will design more better and affordable products for you in the fulture.
Thanks you.

I recently contacted Cycplus referring to the above message, with two questions:

1. Can I get a known good Cycplus (i.e. what is referred to above)
2. For any Cycplus dongle, is there a way to determine if it is the older (unreliable) or newer (hopefully reliable) version

This is the final response:

Unfortunately, I cannot confirm if we can send you a couple of Cycplus Ant+ dongles that are known to be good. I will forward your request to my boss, thanks.

Best Regards,
Cycplus Support Steven
