## Notes

### 1 - Movesense Firmware

*Movesense's* default firmware is a proprietary BLE Service. This does support GATT Heart Rate, but ECG and ACC is not easily available.

They provide an SDK that allows custom firmware to be created.

Custom firmware that implements a GATT style that provides ECG and ACC data as well as Heart Rate
for the Movesense. It is available [here](https://github.com/JonasPrimbs/movesense-ble-ecg-firmware)
