## Overview

The *v0.23* release of *Fitness Dashboard* is finally out. 

This has several new major features:

- BLE Sensors supported, initially Heart Rate Monitors, Moxy, Movesense
- Garmin FIT File support for saving data
- Support for Sauce4Zwift to get additional workout data (e.g. GPS, distance, etc)
- Python command line tool to extract workout data from FIT files

All of the above ended up taking longer than I had originally planned for, and unfortunately because I was
working in parallel on them it was impossible to find a stable release candidate before now.


## Roadmap

Going forward these are the areas I'm targeting:

- BLE support for Power Meters and Trainers
- BLE support VO2Master, with control panel for managing the device
- control panel to start/stop, laps, FIT file 
- reading FIT file for analysis
- power sensor comparison panel
- pan and zoom for graph panel
- additional graph panels, ECG, VO2Master
- save graphs to PDF

## FIT Files

I'll generate a more in depth description of the FIT file support.

Currently data from each sensor is saved separately with a *Record Message* using the *device_index* 
to determine which device the data was collected from. 

Specifically for *Heart Rate Monitors*:
    - RR, correction information and  NN data is saved
    - DFA Alpha1 and if available ECG data (Polar H10 and Movesense)

For *Power Meters*:
    - TSS, est kCal
